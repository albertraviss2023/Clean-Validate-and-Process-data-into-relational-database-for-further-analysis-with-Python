# Clean-Validate-and-Process-data-into-relational-database-for-further-analysis-with-Python
The goal of this project is to clean the data to prepare it for analysis and then import the cleaned data into a relational database. We will use input validation and label encoding to prepare a dataset and SQlite database to import the data. These cleaning techniques used in all types of data analysis, from simple linear regression to complex neural networks. Here we use SQlite because it is free and readily available even in standard OS but the process is the same for other relational database systems.

## General instructions:
This Code Project provides python and SQL code that can be used clean data, and then import the cleaned data into a database. The code is organized into two single files in the parent folder.  

## Main files:
The folder contains 2 .ipynb jupyter Notebook Files from which the user can run all the code. The user needs to set the paths for the .csv data files correctly. 

## Data
The dataset contains companies with a valuation of at least $1 billion. These are often known as "unicorns." The task is to help decision makers develop a better understanding of unicorns; with the hope they can be early investors in future highly successful companies. They are particularly interested in the investment strategies of the three top unicorn investors: Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global Management, and Accel. 

## Jupyter Installation
User needs to have jupyter Notebooks installed in order to run the code in the .ipynb files
